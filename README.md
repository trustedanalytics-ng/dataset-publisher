dataset-publisher
=================

Service for exposing datasets as Hive tables
 
## Details
Service creates table (if it does not already exist) named after dataset title inside of database
(which is also created if it does not already exist) named after organization to which dataset
belongs to. In other words full name of the table is:
`<organization_name>.<dataset_title>`

#### Note
Name of the database, table and columns can be transformed to fit database engine and driver
naming scheme.  
In particular, columns names are transformed as follows:
- all letters are changed to lowercase
- 'x' prefix is added if word does not start with a letter 
- non alphanumeric characters are changed to '_'
- underscore prefix is added if the word is reserved by Impala

## Development

`mvn spring-boot:run`

* `VCAP_SERVICES_SSO_CREDENTIALS_APIENDPOINT` - a Cloud Foundry API endpoint;
* `VCAP_SERVICES_SSO_CREDENTIALS_TOKENKEY` - an UAA endpoint for verifying token signatures;
* `VCAP_SERVICES_ARCADIA_CREDENTIALS_ARCADIAURL` - an Arcadia service address;
